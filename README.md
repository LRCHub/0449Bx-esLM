```
I can't believe my eyes
I swear this must be happening in my mind
I've never seen a stranger sight in all my life
How can I survive?
Should I run
Or should I try to hide?
And still a million other questions fill my mind

AMNESIA
Numbing memories like
ANESTHESIA
Other common side effects include
Who are you?
Who am I?
Who are these other guys?
AMNESIA
All i know is that your pancreas is mine
(Mine, Mine, Mine)
AMNESIA
AMNESIA
(All i know is that your pancreas is)

I gotta get this right
Cuz if I don't, I'm probably going to die
Who are these creatures
And what brought them all to life?
Some of them seem nice
And some have tried to bury me alive
And something tells me
They want to sell me merchandise

AMNESIA
Numbing memories like
ANESTHESIA
Other common side effects include
Who are you?
Who am I?
Who are these other guys?
AMNESIA
Till I'm pretty sure your pancreas is mine
(Mine, Mine, Mine)
(It's all your fault)
AMNESIA
(It's all your fault)
AMNESIA
(AMNESIA)

AMNESIA
Numbing memories like
ANESTHESIA
Other common side effects include
Who are you?
Who am I?
Who are these other guys?
AMNESIA
Till I'm
Pretty sure
Your pan
Cre
As
Is
MINE!
(It's all your fault)
"Yeah, yeah"

AMNESIA
(It's all your fault)
Oh, now I'm pretty sure
YOUR
PANCREAS
IS
MINE!
(Mine, Mine, Mine, Mine, Mine)
